ðŸ”¬**We are RO's Research and Development Team** ðŸš€

Rogers O'Brien has been building Texas for the last 50 years and has no plans to slow down. The R&D team is instrumental in driving the technological advances that help make RO a premier general contractor. We are a younger branch within RO but quickly growing in size and scope as we drive changes that make processes within the company more efficient and headache-free.

Our primary objective is to simplify the lives of all employees within the company. We oversee the innovation station, an internal platform where any employee can propose an idea to enhance the company's performance. Our team uses three criteria, including an objective scoring method, idea popularity, and directives from leadership, to prioritize which ideas to pursue. Once we've identified the most promising concepts, we conduct thorough research to determine the best approach to realizing them, and if feasible, we create prototypes of potential solutions.
